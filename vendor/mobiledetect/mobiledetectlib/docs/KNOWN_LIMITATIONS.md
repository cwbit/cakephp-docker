**Known limitations**

* Mobile Detect script was designed to detect `mobile` devices. Implicitly other devices are considered to be `desktop`.
* User-Agent and HTTP headers sniffing is a non-reliable method of detecting a mobile device.
* If the mobile browser is set on `Desktop mode`, the Mobile Detect script has no indicator (eg. a group of strings) that would allow it to detect that the device is `mobile`.
* Ipad 2019 is being recognized as a desktop because of Safari's default `Request Desktop Website` setting. See details and possible workaround [#820](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect/issues/820)
* Some touchscreen devices (eg. Microsoft Surface) are tough to detect as mobile since they can be used in a laptop mode. See: [#32](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect/issues/32), [#461](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect/issues/461), [#667](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect/issues/667)
* Some mobile devices (eg. IPadOS, Google Pixel Slate). See: [#795](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect/issues/795), [#788](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect/issues/788)
* Detecting the device brand (eg. Apple, Samsung, HTC) is not 100% reliable.
* We don't monitor the quality of the 3rd party tools based on Mobile Detect script. 
We cannot guarantee that they are using the class properly or if they provide the latest version.
* Version `2.x` is made to be PHP 5.3 compatible because of the backward compatibility changes of PHP.
* There are hundreds of devices launched every month, we cannot keep a 100% up to date detection rate.
* The script cannot detect the viewport, pixel density or resolution of the screen since it's running server-side.
