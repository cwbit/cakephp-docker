DebugKit provides a debugging toolbar and enhanced debugging tools for CakePHP
applications. It lets you quickly see configuration data, log messages, SQL
queries, and timing data for your application.

:warning: DebugKit is only intended for use in single-user local development
environments. You should avoid using DebugKit in shared development
environments, staging environments, or any environment where you need to keep
configuration data and environment variables hidden. :warning:

## Requirements

* SQLite (pdo_sqlite) or another database driver that CakePHP can talk to. By
  default DebugKit will use SQLite, if you need to use a different database see the Database Configuration section in the documentation linked below.

For details and older versions see [version map](https://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit/wiki#version-map).

## Installation

* Install the plugin with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) from your CakePHP Project's ROOT directory (where the **composer.json** file is located)
```sh
php composer.phar require --dev cakephp/debug_kit:"^4.0"
```

* [Load the plugin](https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/plugins.html#loading-a-plugin)
```php
// src/Application.php
$this->addPlugin('DebugKit');
```
* Set `'debug' => true,` in `config/app.php`.

## Is DebugKit not working?

If you don't see a CakePHP icon on the bottom right of your page DebugKit is not be
working correctly. Some common problems are:
 
1. Your PHP environment doesn't have SQLite installed. Check your application
   logs to confirm if this happening. You can either configure DebugKit to use
   a different database, or install the PDO SQLite 3 extension.
2. Your hostname needs to be added to the `DebugKit.safeTld`. If your local
   domain isn't a known development environment name, DebugKit will disable
   itself to protect a potentially non-development environment.
